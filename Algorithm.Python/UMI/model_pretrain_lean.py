'''
UMI Pretrain Models (adapted for Lean)

ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Populate this file with the content from src/model_pretrain.py of the UMI GitHub repository.
2. Adjust import statements to use relative imports for other UMI modules in this directory (e.g., `from .utils_lean import ...`).
3. Ensure all class definitions like `stk_dic`, `stk_classification_att1`, etc., are copied correctly.
